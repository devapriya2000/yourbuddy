### Project Description
A fun and slightly sadistic Website that tracks moods, gives personalized recommendations,adds a daily dose of hilariously brutal roasting and many more.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are tired of boring self-care apps. Why just track moods when you can get roasted while doing it?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We track moods and browsing history, provide movie/song/activity suggestions, and sprinkle in funny, savage commentary. Self-reflection is now sarcastic, interactive, and entertaining.
